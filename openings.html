  <h1>Job Openings</h1>
  <p>Before applying for a job, you need to consider many factors, including what type of job you want, where the job is, and your monthly/yearly salary.</p>
  <p>Next, you want to put your profile online, such as on sites like Linkedin. This will allow companies to view your profile and experiences and hence, more likely to call you.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, you want to make sure that you get multiple offers and take time before coming to a final decision.</p>
